INSTALL
-------
These instructions are for a manual installation using FTP, cPanel or other web hosting Control Panel.

- Linux Install -

1. Upload all of the files and folders to your server from the "Upload" folder, place them in your web root. The web root is different on some servers, cPanel it should be public_html/ and on Plesk it should be httpdocs/.

2. Make sure your web user has the permission to read, write and execute all directories under the web root.

3. Rename config-dist.php to config.php and admin/config-dist.php to admin/config.php

4. For Linux/Unix make sure the following folders and files are writable.

		chmod 0755 or 0777 config.php
		chmod 0755 or 0777 admin/config.php

		If 0755 does not work try 0777.

5. Make sure you have installed a MySQL Database which has a user assigned to it
	DO NOT USE YOUR ROOT USERNAME AND ROOT PASSWORD

6. Visit the store homepage e.g. http://www.example.com or http://www.example.com/store/

7. You should be taken to the installer page. Follow the on screen instructions.

8. After successful install, delete the /install/ directory from ftp.

9. If you have downloaded the compiled version with a folder called "vendor" - this should be uploaded above the webroot (so the same folder where the public_html or httpdocs is)


- Windows Install -

1. Upload all the files and folders to your server from the "Upload" folder. This can be to anywhere of your choice. e.g. /wwwroot/store or /wwwroot

2. Rename config-dist.php to config.php and admin/config-dist.php to admin/config.php

3. For Windows make sure the following folders and files permissions allow Read and Write.

		config.php
		admin/config.php

4. Make sure you have installed a MySQL Database which has a user assigned to it
	DO NOT USE YOUR ROOT USERNAME AND ROOT PASSWORD

5. You should be taken to the installer page. Follow the on screen instructions.

6. After successful install, delete the /install/ directory.

- Local Install -

There are many all-in-one web servers out there and most of them should work with OpenCart out of the box. Some examples...

Godaddy Issues

If your hosting on godaddy you might need to rename the php.ini to user.ini

It seems godadddy has started changing the industry standard names of files.

----------------------------
COMPOSER OR NOT TO COMPOSER
----------------------------
From version 2.2 composer has been added to aid developers who want to use composer libraries. 2 versions of OpenCart
will become available, one compiled and one non-compiled (composer.json only - no files in vendor folder).

We STRONGLY advise leaving the vendor folder outside of the webroot - so files cannot be accessed directly.

Composer installing is extremely simple - https://getcomposer.org
